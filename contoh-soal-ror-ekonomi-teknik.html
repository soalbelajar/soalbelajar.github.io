                                            THE GOOSE THAT LAID THE GOLDEN EGGSBy Nicky GrischottiThere once was a very poor farmer. So poor he lived in an old tumble-down pigsty in the middle of no-where with only acorns and the odd goose egg to eat and a bale of straw for his bed. His name was Attacus Greeb.Now Attacus Greeb hadn’t always been poor. He’d inherited a large and prosperous farm from his father and he’d owned land as far as the eye could see. But Attacus Greeb was a lazy man. He didn’t like work.'I'm far too good to be milking cows,' he said. 'I should be Lord of the Manor with servants and footmen…and heaps of silver and gold.'So over the years, instead of work-ing for a living he'd simply sold off his possessions.He'd sold almost everything hisfather had given him - his house, his land, his horses, his pigs, his cattle and all he was left with was one single goose who lived with him. 'Oh what is to become of me?'wailed Attacus late one night. 'I have no house, no food and no money and nothing left to sell…I shall surely starve!' And then he looked at his goose. 'It's no good honking at me goosey it's off with you to the market to-morrow – you haven't laid an egg in weeks and your feathers will fetch me a fair few guineas.' And off he went to sleep. The next morning Attacus Greeb awoke to a glittering dawn. It was so light and bright he had to shield his eyes. But it wasn't the sunlight shining, he could hardly believe what he saw, it was a gigantic, glorious…Golden Egg! 'You clever girl! Ha! H!a Ho! Ho! We'll be rich! Rich beyond our dreams!'So off he went to market pushing the egg in an old wheelbarrow… and back he came with a barrowful of meat to cook, chicken feed for his goose and a huge bag of coins.'Oh how I wish I had money to buy a horse-drawn carriage,' he said patting his full tummy that night.'That's what I need to be happy.'Well, the very next morning the same thing happened…there was another shiny golden egg lying beside the goose. So off went Attacus to market and with the money he got he bought a smart black carriage and six sleek horses. And every day the same thing hap-pened and every day Attacus Greeb counted his money and wished for more and more.But as fast as the little goose could lay a golden egg Attacus Greeb wanted more. 'Why can't you lay more eggs each day? We need more, we need more I say!'Soon the farmer became a very rich man indeed – but as he grew rich, he grew greedy – and still he wanted more. And then he had an idea.'How I wish I could have all the golden eggs at once,' he thought, 'instead of just one a day. Then I would surely be happy.'So the next morning he ordered his cook to kill the goose and open it up so he could take out all the eggs at once – but, of course, to his hor-ror there was nothing inside the poor goose…and there would be no golden eggs again.And Attacus Greeb ended up back in his tumble-down pigsty - just where he belonged!1.What is the story about?2.What are the problems of the story?3.What is the moral of the story?4.Find a proverb that has similar meaning to the moral of the story?5.What is the genre of the story?6.Mention the language features of the story with their examples?7.What is the purpose of the Story?​</a>

Habibie was born in Parepare, South Sulawesi Province to Alwi Abdul Jalil Habibie and R. A. Tuti Marini Puspowardojo. His father was an agriculturist from Gorontalo of Bugis descent and his mother was a Javanese noblewomen from Yogyakarta. His parents met while studying in Bogor. When he was 14 years old, Habibie’s father died.Following his father’s death, Habibie continued his studies in Jakarta and then in 1955 moved to Germany. In 1960, Habibie received a degree in engineering in Germany, giving him the title Diplom-Ingenieur. He remained in Germany as a research assistant under Hans Ebner at the Lehrstuhl und Institut fur Leichtbau, RWTH Aachen to conduct research for his doctoral degree.In 1962, Habibie returned to Indonesia ror three months on sick leave. During this time, he was reacquainted with Hasri Ainun, the daughter of R. Mohamad Besari. The two married on 12 May 1962, returning to Germany shortly afterwards. Habibie and his wife settled in Aachen for a short period before moving to Oberforstbach. In May 1963 they had their first son, Ilham Akbar Habibie, and later another son, Thareq Kemal Habibie.When Habibie’s minimum wage salary forced him into part-time work, he found employment with the Automotive Marque Talbot, where he became an advisor. Habibie worked on two projects which received funding from Deutsche Bundesbahn. Due to his work with Makosh, the head of train constructions offered his position to Habibie upon his retirement three years later, but Habibie refused.Habibie did accept a position with Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm Hamburg. There, heedeveloped theories on thermodynamics, contruction, and aerodynamics known as the Habibie Factor, Habibie Theorem, and Habibie Method, respectively. He worked for Messerschmit on the development of the Airbus A-300B aircraft. In 1974, he was promoted to vice president of the company.In 1974, Suharto requested Habibie to return to Indonesia as part of Suharto’s drive to develop the country.

In 1978, he was appointed as Minister of Research and Technology. Habibie was elected vice president in March 1998. On 21 May 1998, Suharto publicly announced his resignation and Habibie was immediately sworn in as president. Habibie’s government stabilized the economy in the face of the Asian financial crisis and the chaos of the last few months of Suharto’s presidency.Since relinquishing the presidency, Habibie has spent more time in Germany than in Indonesia. However, he has also been active as a presidential adviser during Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s presidency.

His father was an agriculturist from Gorontalo of Bugis descent and his mother was a Javanese noblewomen from Yogyakarta. His parents met while studying in Bogor.

In 1960, Habibie received a degree in engineering in Germany, giving him the title Diplom-Ingenieur. He remained in Germany as a research assistant under Hans Ebner at the Lehrstuhl und Institut fur Leichtbau, RWTH Aachen to conduct research for his doctoral degree.
In 1962, Habibie returned to Indonesia ror three months on sick leave. During this time, he was reacquainted with Hasri Ainun, the daughter of R. Mohamad Besari. The two married on 12 May 1962, returning to Germany shortly afterwards. Habibie and his wife settled in Aachen for a short period before moving to Oberforstbach. In May 1963 they had their first son, Ilham Akbar Habibie, and later another son, Thareq Kemal Habibie.
When Habibie’s minimum wage salary forced him into part-time work, he found employment with the Automotive Marque Talbot, where he became an advisor. Habibie worked on two projects which received funding from Deutsche Bundesbahn. Due to his work with Makosh, the head of train constructions offered his position to Habibie upon his retirement three years later, but Habibie refused.

                            16. THE GOOSE THAT LAID THE GOLDEN EGGSBy Nicky GrischottiThere once was a very poor farmer. So poor he lived in an old tumble-down pigsty in the middle of no-where with only acorns and the odd goose egg to eat and a bale of straw for his bed. His name was Attacus Greeb.Now Attacus Greeb hadn’t always been poor. He’d inherited a large and prosperous farm from his father and he’d owned land as far as the eye could see. But Attacus Greeb was a lazy man. He didn’t like work.'I'm far too good to be milking cows,' he said. 'I should be Lord of the Manor with servants and footmen…and heaps of silver and gold.'So over the years, instead of work-ing for a living he'd simply sold off his possessions.He'd sold almost everything hisfather had given him - his house, his land, his horses, his pigs, his cattle and all he was left with was one single goose who lived with him. 'Oh what is to become of me?'wailed Attacus late one night. 'I have no house, no food and no money and nothing left to sell…I shall surely starve!' And then he looked at his goose. 'It's no good honking at me goosey it's off with you to the market to-morrow – you haven't laid an egg in weeks and your feathers will fetch me a fair few guineas.' And off he went to sleep. The next morning Attacus Greeb awoke to a glittering dawn. It was so light and bright he had to shield his eyes. But it wasn't the sunlight shining, he could hardly believe what he saw, it was a gigantic, glorious…Golden Egg! 'You clever girl! Ha! H!a Ho! Ho! We'll be rich! Rich beyond our dreams!'So off he went to market pushing the egg in an old wheelbarrow… and back he came with a barrowful of meat to cook, chicken feed for his goose and a huge bag of coins.'Oh how I wish I had money to buy a horse-drawn carriage,' he said patting his full tummy that night.'That's what I need to be happy.'Well, the very next morning the same thing happened…there was another shiny golden egg lying beside the goose. So off went Attacus to market and with the money he got he bought a smart black carriage and six sleek horses. And every day the same thing hap-pened and every day Attacus Greeb counted his money and wished for more and more.But as fast as the little goose could lay a golden egg Attacus Greeb wanted more. 'Why can't you lay more eggs each day? We need more, we need more I say!'Soon the farmer became a very rich man indeed – but as he grew rich, he grew greedy – and still he wanted more. And then he had an idea.'How I wish I could have all the golden eggs at once,' he thought, 'instead of just one a day. Then I would surely be happy.'So the next morning he ordered his cook to kill the goose and open it up so he could take out all the eggs at once – but, of course, to his hor-ror there was nothing inside the poor goose…and there would be no golden eggs again.And Attacus Greeb ended up back in his tumble-down pigsty - just where he belonged!1.What is the story about?2.What are the problems of the story?3.What is the moral of the story?4.Find a proverb that has similar meaning to the moral of the story?5.What is the genre of the story?6.Mention the language features of the story with their examples?7.What is the purpose of the Story?​</h2><br />

During this time, he was reacquainted with Hasri Ainun, the daughter of R. Mohamad Besari. The two married on 12 May 1962, returning to Germany shortly afterwards. Habibie and his wife settled in Aachen for a short period before moving to Oberforstbach. In May 1963 they had their first son, Ilham Akbar Habibie, and later another son, Thareq Kemal Habibie.When Habibie’s minimum wage salary forced him into part-time work, he found employment with the Automotive Marque Talbot, where he became an advisor. Habibie worked on two projects which received funding from Deutsche Bundesbahn. Due to his work with Makosh, the head of train constructions offered his position to Habibie upon his retirement three years later, but Habibie refused.Habibie did accept a position with Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm Hamburg.
