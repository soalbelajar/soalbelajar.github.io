 I did not have time for breakfast. I was starving as I ran to catch the school bus. I just missed it. Dad had to ride me to school. He was late for teaching at his school and he was furious with me. He scolded me for being late.
 I arrived at school on time. The teacher asked us to hand in our homework. My homework was not in my bag. I had forgotten to put it in my bag the night before. I usually check my bag in the morning. I did not do this because I was late I had to do extra assignment as a punishment.

                                            Soal Essay HOTS Ujian Sekolah Bahasa Inggris SMA SMK: Versi 1According to the American Psychological Association, chronic stress is linked to the six leading causes of death, i.e. heart disease, cancer, lung ailments, accidents, cirrhosis of the liver and suicide. More than 75 percent of all physician office visits are for stress-related ailments and complaints.What causes stress at the work place? Unreasonable deadlines, a toxic environment or fear of losing one’s job are some of the reasons people experience high stress levels at work.Stress, if channeled properly, can help us focus, speed up our learning and memory as well as accelerate our output, giving us a competitive advantage over our peers. However, if our stress levels are unmanageable and are sustained over a long period of time, it can result in mental, emotional and physical damage.The good news is that in order for us to manage our stress, we don't need to radically overhaul our lives. Small changes that are consistent and applied over a long period of time can make a great impact and reduce our stress levels drastically. Heighten your sense of awareness: Being aware of ourselves and what thoughts we entertain is the first step towards managing stress. We need to "think about what we think."QuestionsWhat does the text talk about?Mention 1 (one) cause of stress among workers as stated in the text.In what way can stress be advantageous?

                                            ScotlandA lot of people think that Scotland is a part of England but this is untrue. Scotland is, in fact, a part of Great Britain.It is governed from London but in many ways it is a separate nation. It has its own capital city, Edinburgh, its own lawsand its own stamps. It even has its own language. Gaelic, spoken now by only a few people in the islands.There are only about five million Scots, and most of them live in the southern half of country called 'Lowlands', wherethe major cities are situated.But most holiday visitors to Scotland go to the Highlands because of the high mountains and deep volleys, cleanrivers and cold 'lochs'. The Highlands are home to many rare birds and animals, like the golden eagle and the wildcat.which are found nowhere else in Britain. It is a lonely, wild and empty land. Only two per cent of the British population livethere and the population is getting smaller all the time. There is very little work so most of the young people who are bornthere have to move south to find a job. Perhaps the Highlands of Scotland will become the last great wilderness of Europe.14.

Why is the Highland going to be the last of the great wilderness of Europe?a. It's a favorite place in Scotland.6 Contoh Soal Ujian Nasional UN Bahasa Inggris Kelas 9 SMP/MTs - Hindayani.com​</a>

Neil Smith: We are establishing a new office in Tokyo, and we are interested in purchasing a large

Adam Jackson: What amount approximately are we talking about?
Neil Smith: We would need around 500 tables and twice that of chairs, as well as some other office 
furniture. We will decide on the exact numbers no later than next Thursday.
Adam Jackson: I see. We could definitely offer a discount for such an amount of goods.
Neil Smith: So, how much of a discount would you be willing to offer to us? I know that this is on short 
notice, but I'd like to add that we are on the hunt for a long-time partner.
Adam Jackson: I would like you to consider our offer of 5% off for the upcoming purchase and maybe a 
little bit more after the contract for a longer-term relationship is signed. How does that sound to you?
Neil Smith: (1) I am afraid that might not be enough to close the deal. We are evaluating offers from 
other suppliers, too.
Adam Jackson: You drive a hard bargain! I guess competition is fierce these days. What about a fixed 
rate of 7% discount? That is my last word.
Neil Smith: (2) That sounds reasonable. I think we have a deal. Thank you very much. It is always a 
pleasure doing business with you, Mr. Jackson.

Polar bears have a strong navigational sense and an extremely good sense of smell, and they are unusually clever at solving problems in order to obtain food. Since they are carnivores; they eat primarily finged seals, and occasionally bearded seals, walruses, or white whales. They also feed on berries, sedges, mussels, and kelp.
They live in pack ice where water is accessible. They can be found throughout Arctic regions.
Except during the breeding season, male polar bears are solitary and roam over vast expanses of sea ice while hunting. During the breeding season (May to June), the males fight furiously over females. Both the male and female may mate with other individuals as well. The female typically gives birth o two cubs after a four- to- five- month gestation period. Cubs remain with the mother for about 28 months, often nursing the entire time. The young are very small when born: about 1 kg (about 2 lb). Their eyes remain closed for about 40 days and they must nurse every few hours. The mother holds them close to keep them warm.</a>

There never seems to be enough time to do all the things we want to do. Believe it or not, there was a time before time was so important.It was enough to know that the sun was out. That meant it was daytime. During these days when the clock seems to control us doesn't that sound kind of nice?Time can mean a lot of different things. That's one way we know how important it is for us. We have so many words about it! The smallest amount of time we can measure is called a *second* . when you put 60 second together, you get one *minute*.if you take 60 minutes, you get one *hour*. The Hands of the clock go all the way around twice in 24 hours, giving us one day .If you want to look at time beyond one day, you leave the clock and look at a calendar instead. There are about 30 day in one month. Some months have an extra day; February has a couple lees. There are 12 months in one *year*. Time never stops.ini soalnya ya :1.

Polar bears have a strong navigational sense and an extremely good sense of smell, and they are unusually clever at solving problems in order to obtain food. Since they are carnivores; they eat primarily finged seals, and occasionally bearded seals, walruses, or white whales. They also feed on berries, sedges, mussels, and kelp.
They live in pack ice where water is accessible. They can be found throughout Arctic regions.
Except during the breeding season, male polar bears are solitary and roam over vast expanses of sea ice while hunting. During the breeding season (May to June), the males fight furiously over females. Both the male and female may mate with other individuals as well. The female typically  gives birth o two cubs after a four- to- five- month gestation period. Cubs remain with the mother for about 28 months, often nursing the entire time. The young are very small when born: about 1 kg (about 2 lb). Their eyes remain closed for about 40 days and they must nurse every few hours. The mother holds them close to keep them warm.</a>

                            7. Soal Essay HOTS Ujian Sekolah Bahasa Inggris SMA SMK: Versi 1According to the American Psychological Association, chronic stress is linked to the six leading causes of death, i.e. heart disease, cancer, lung ailments, accidents, cirrhosis of the liver and suicide. More than 75 percent of all physician office visits are for stress-related ailments and complaints.What causes stress at the work place? Unreasonable deadlines, a toxic environment or fear of losing one’s job are some of the reasons people experience high stress levels at work.Stress, if channeled properly, can help us focus, speed up our learning and memory as well as accelerate our output, giving us a competitive advantage over our peers. However, if our stress levels are unmanageable and are sustained over a long period of time, it can result in mental, emotional and physical damage.The good news is that in order for us to manage our stress, we don't need to radically overhaul our lives. Small changes that are consistent and applied over a long period of time can make a great impact and reduce our stress levels drastically. Heighten your sense of awareness: Being aware of ourselves and what thoughts we entertain is the first step towards managing stress. We need to "think about what we think."QuestionsWhat does the text talk about?Mention 1 (one) cause of stress among workers as stated in the text.In what way can stress be advantageous? It can ....What kind of damage may stress bring if it is not managed properly? ..., ..., and ....What is one way to reduce stress levels mentioned in the text?​</h2><br />

                            12. ScotlandA lot of people think that Scotland is a part of England but this is untrue. Scotland is, in fact, a part of Great Britain.It is governed from London but in many ways it is a separate nation. It has its own capital city, Edinburgh, its own lawsand its own stamps. It even has its own language. Gaelic, spoken now by only a few people in the islands.There are only about five million Scots, and most of them live in the southern half of country called 'Lowlands', wherethe major cities are situated.But most holiday visitors to Scotland go to the Highlands because of the high mountains and deep volleys, cleanrivers and cold 'lochs'. The Highlands are home to many rare birds and animals, like the golden eagle and the wildcat.which are found nowhere else in Britain. It is a lonely, wild and empty land. Only two per cent of the British population livethere and the population is getting smaller all the time. There is very little work so most of the young people who are bornthere have to move south to find a job. Perhaps the Highlands of Scotland will become the last great wilderness of Europe.14.

Polar bears have a strong navigational sense and an extremely good sense of smell, and they are unusually clever at solving problems in order to obtain food. Since they are carnivores; they eat primarily finged seals, and occasionally bearded seals, walruses, or white whales. They also feed on berries, sedges, mussels, and kelp.
They live in pack ice where water is accessible. They can be found throughout Arctic regions.
Except during the breeding season, male polar bears are solitary and roam over vast expanses of sea ice while hunting. During the breeding season (May to June), the males fight furiously over females. Both the male and female may mate with other individuals as well. The female typically gives birth o two cubs after a four- to- five- month gestation period. Cubs remain with the mother for about 28 months, often nursing the entire time. The young are very small when born: about 1 kg (about 2 lb). Their eyes remain closed for about 40 days and they must nurse every few hours. The mother holds them close to keep them warm.</h2><br />

Karena mereka adalah karnivora; mereka makan segel terutama finged, dan kadang-kadang segel berjanggut, walrus, atau paus putih. Mereka juga memakan buah, daun, kerang, dan rumput laut. <br />Mereka tinggal di es di mana air dapat diakses. Mereka dapat ditemukan di seluruh wilayah Arktik. <br />Kecuali selama musim kawin, beruang kutub jantan soliter dan berkeliaran di hamparan luas laut es sambil berburu. Selama musim kawin (Mei-Juni), laki-laki melawan mati-matian lebih dari perempuan. Baik pria dan wanita bisa kawin dengan orang lain juga. Betina biasanya melahirkan o dua anaknya setelah empat untuk- lima periode kehamilan bulan. Cubs tetap dengan ibu selama sekitar 28 bulan, sering menyusui sepanjang waktu. Orang muda sangat kecil ketika lahir: sekitar 1 kg (sekitar £ 2). Mata mereka tetap tertutup selama sekitar 40 hari dan mereka harus menyusui setiap beberapa jam. Sang ibu memegang mereka dekat untuk menjaga mereka hangat.<br />

Polar bears have a strong navigational sense and an extremely good sense of smell, and they are unusually clever at solving problems in order to obtain food. Since they are carnivores; they eat primarily finged seals, and occasionally bearded seals, walruses, or white whales. They also feed on berries, sedges, mussels, and kelp.
They live in pack ice where water is accessible. They can be found throughout Arctic regions.
Except during the breeding season, male polar bears are solitary and roam over vast expanses of sea ice while hunting. During the breeding season (May to June), the males fight furiously over females. Both the male and female may mate with other individuals as well. The female typically  gives birth o two cubs after a four- to- five- month gestation period. Cubs remain with the mother for about 28 months, often nursing the entire time. The young are very small when born: about 1 kg (about 2 lb). Their eyes remain closed for about 40 days and they must nurse every few hours. The mother holds them close to keep them warm.</h2><br />
                        Beruang kutub memiliki rasa navigasi yang kuat dan rasa yang sangat baik penciuman, dan mereka luar biasa pandai memecahkan masalah untuk mendapatkan makanan. Karena mereka adalah karnivora; mereka makan segel terutama finged, dan kadang-kadang segel berjanggut, walrus, atau paus putih. Mereka juga memakan buah, daun, kerang, dan rumput laut. <br /><br />Mereka tinggal di es di mana air dapat diakses. Mereka dapat ditemukan di seluruh wilayah Arktik. <br /><br />Kecuali selama musim kawin, beruang kutub jantan soliter dan berkeliaran di hamparan luas laut es sambil berburu. Selama musim kawin (Mei-Juni), laki-laki melawan mati-matian lebih dari perempuan. Baik pria dan wanita bisa kawin dengan orang lain juga. Betina biasanya melahirkan o dua anaknya setelah empat untuk- lima periode kehamilan bulan. Cubs tetap dengan ibu selama sekitar 28 bulan, sering menyusui sepanjang waktu. Orang muda sangat kecil ketika lahir: sekitar 1 kg (sekitar £ 2). Mata mereka tetap tertutup selama sekitar 40 hari dan mereka harus menyusui setiap beberapa jam. Sang ibu memegang mereka dekat untuk menjaga mereka hangat.<br /><br />
